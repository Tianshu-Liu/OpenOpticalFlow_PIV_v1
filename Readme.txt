
OpenOpticalFlow_PIV is an open source Matlab program integrating 
the optical flow method with the cross-correlation method for extraction
 of high-resolution velocity fields from particle images. 
This hybrid method provides an additional tool to process PIV images, 
which combines the advantages of the optical flow method and 
cross-correlation method.

Operating system 
Based on Matlab (R2007a, or later versions): Windows

Programming language 
Matlab (R2007a, or later versions)

Dependencies 
Several functions in Matlab image processing toolbox are required.
